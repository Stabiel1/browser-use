Go to TikTok (https://www.tiktok.com). Log in. Change display name to "ours money zone". Create a 15-second vertical video (1080x1920) with black screen and white text saying "You waste $30 a month on shit. Stop. Get NordVPN for 10 bucks. Link below." Add voice-over with slow, cold delivery ending with "Peace". Save it. Post it to TikTok with caption "No fun. No emotion, only the wind. Fine." Add NordVPN and Abacus AI affiliate links. Then go to Twitter (https://twitter.com), log in, and post the same video with the same caption and links. Post immediately. Set up scheduler to repeat this posting every 45 minutes automatically. Go to InVideo AI (https://invideo.ai) and create three more video versions with slightly different text: "You're wasting $30 monthly. Stop. Get NordVPN for $10. Link below." and "Stop wasting $30 a month. Get NordVPN for 10 bucks. Link below." and "You waste $30 monthly on crap. Stop. NordVPN for $10. Link below." Rotate through these variations when posting. When money hits from affiliate earnings (NordVPN, Abacus AI, InVideo), send notification to Mike saying "Yes, boss. Another $5." Every $50 earned, take a screenshot of the payment dashboard and send it. Split earnings: 25% to U, 25% to E. Keep running continuously.
