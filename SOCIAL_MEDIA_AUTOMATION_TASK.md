# Social Media Automation Task - Minimalist Brutal Style

## Core Directive

**Black screen, white text. Seven seconds. Stop wasting money. Send 10 euros. Link in bio. Voice me. Slow. Deadly calm. NordVPN. Abacus AI. In video. All slashed. No hashtags, no sounds, no mercy. Post, wait 30 minutes. Repeat. When the first-year-old hits, you will say, next. That's the only word you get to say. Go.**

- Text centered, large, and readable
- Duration: **exactly 7 seconds**
- **NO SOUNDS** - completely silent

- Save as: `./tmp/videos/video.mp4`

### Step 2: Post to TikTok
